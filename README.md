# Leaflet-GPX-Map
### Leaflet map to show gpx tracks with some additional plugins.


Took me about two months to code, starting from zero knowledge about javascript.
Now, around six months later, that I know a little bit about coding and leaflet finally outed version 1.0, I decided to clean and rewrite some of the code and publish it.

I'm still very much a beginner hobbyist at javascript, so all comments are much appreciated.

Few example GPX tracks included.
